# Job Finder

This project involves creating a job finder web application using the Random User Generator API. The application will consist of two pages: a login page and a main page with a 3-column layout for displaying user information.

## Project Overview

The Job Finder project aims to replicate certain features of LinkedIn, focusing on user authentication and displaying user profiles. The main functionalities include:

- A home page with a header, footer, and a 3-column layout, designed based on provided examples (responsive design is optional).
- A login page (login.html) that allows users to log in using stored credentials.
- User login information (username and password) stored in localStorage for authentication.
- Upon clicking the login button, the system accesses localStorage to compare the provided data and either redirects the user to the home page or displays an error message.
- The main user's profile, including a picture and manually added data.
- Displaying profiles of other users (contacts, connections, or suggested connections - at least 10) retrieved from the Random User Generator API.
- Displaying user profile pictures, full names, and cities.
- Consistent design elements such as colors, fonts, and margins across all project pages.


## Project Structure

The project is organized into the following components:

- **login.html**: The login page where users enter their credentials.
- **home.html**: The main page with a 3-column layout displaying user profiles.
- **CSS**: Styling for the application's layout and design.
- **JavaScript**: Logic for user authentication, API data retrieval, and page interactions.

## Usage

1. Open `login.html` to access the login page.
2. Enter your credentials (stored in localStorage) and click the login button.
3. Upon successful login, you will be redirected to the main page (`home.html`), where user profiles are displayed.
4. User profiles include profile pictures, full names, and cities.
